**The Challenge:** Build a Postgres Database and execute queries against it.  



**The Solution:**  ...Google

Honestly the data engineering was definitely the harder part of this assignment. I used Quick DBD to get my table schemas, then I altered that output to deal with some errors it produced...

I used DBeaver to create/manage my database and spent a fair amount of time learning the differences between that application and PGAdmin. (Accidentally deleted a database at one point, then created all sorts of weird **not-database-y** things. What and why is a project?)

Even when I completed the table, I was unsure that my data relations were properly designated.

Finally, I made the queries in like 2 seconds.
